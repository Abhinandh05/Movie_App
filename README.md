## 📱 About This Project

This is a modern [Expo](https://expo.dev) project bootstrapped with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app), designed to help you build amazing cross-platform mobile applications with React Native.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Expo CLI (optional but recommended)

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone & Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project directory
   cd your-expo-app
   
   # Install all dependencies
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Launch the Expo development server
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Run Your App**
   
   After starting the server, you'll see a QR code and several options:

   | Platform | Method | Description |
   |----------|--------|-------------|
   | 📱 **iOS** | iOS Simulator | Press `i` to open in iOS Simulator |
   | 🤖 **Android** | Android Emulator | Press `a` to open in Android Emulator |
   | 📲 **Physical Device** | Expo Go App | Scan QR code with Expo Go app |
   | 🏗️ **Development Build** | Custom Build | For production-ready features |

## 🛠️ Development

### File Structure
```
your-expo-app/
├── app/              # 📁 Main app directory (file-based routing)
├── assets/           # 🖼️ Images, fonts, and other assets
├── components/       # 🧩 Reusable React components
├── constants/        # 📋 App constants and configuration
└── package.json      # 📦 Project dependencies
```

### 🎨 Start Building
Begin developing by editing files in the **`app`** directory. This project uses Expo's powerful [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) system.

## 🔄 Fresh Start

Ready to build something new? Reset your project:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

> **What this does:**
> - Moves starter code to `app-example/` directory
> - Creates a clean `app/` directory for your custom development
> - Gives you a blank slate to start building
